### Super Stickman Golf!

This project is a recreation of the iconic mobile game, Super Stickman Golf 2.

The main goal of this game is to get your
golf ball into the hole in the lowest number of moves possible, while having to utilize/avoid the hazards of the course.
There are power-ups such as mulligans, air brakes, and mid-air bounces making the game super.
